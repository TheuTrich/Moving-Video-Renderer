# Moving-Video-Renderer
make your video with moving effect
## Required
1. Install required libraries
2. Change the 'bad.mkv' to your video path(with extension)
3. VERY IMPORTANT. Make sure you have **enough space** on your drive, other than it will **crash**. The 3 minutes 27 MB video can be rendered to 2GB. But don't worry much it has an ***acceptable render speed***.
### Notes
The code looks bad I don't know to optimize it.
